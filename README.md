# MIDI Practice tool

<https://krippix.github.io/MIDI_practice/html/>

I am trying to develop a small tool to improve my (beginner-level) sightreading.
For that I want to use the MIDI integration of my piano in order to quickly check if I am playing the correct notes.

## TODO

- [ ] Handle if no notes or clefs are selected!
- [ ] Implement chords
- [ ] Handle MIDI disconnect? (Stuck piano on svg)

## usage

- MIDI only works in combination with HTTPS
