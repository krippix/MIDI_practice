# MIDI Practice tool

<https://krippix.github.io/MIDI_practice/html/>

I am trying to develop a small tool to improve my (beginner-level) sightreading.
For that I want to use the MIDI integration of my piano in order to quickly check if I am playing the correct notes.

## usage

- in order for MIDI to work https must be used
- nginx doesen't seem to properly serve the svg wihtout adding mimetypes to the nginx.conf: `include /etc/nginx/mime.types;`
